# Smart-Garage-System

## System Requirements
<ol>
<li>The capacity of the garage is 2000 cars.</li>
<li>System is used in underground parking lot of a hotel.</li>
<li>Each user of the garage has a remote unit which he can use for opening and closing the garage door.</li>
<li>Remote unit has only a single button.</li>
<li>User is allowed to retrieve the car at any point of time</li>
<li>A LCD Display is available indicating the number of cars in the garage.</li>
<li>System runs from a standard power inlet available in the garage.</li>
<li>When the number of cars reaches 2000, the LCD displays ”FULL”</li>
<li>When there are no cars, the LCD displays “EMPTY”</li>
</ol>

## System Specifications
<ol>
<li>Remote unit button toggles the condition of the garage door- i.e. if the door is opened it is closed
and vice versa.</li>
<li>The remote unit is used for short distances only.</li>
<li>A DC motor is used for opening and closing the door – The motor is a 50V -3 A motor.</li>
<li>Maximum frequency input to the motor system cannot exceed 100 KHz.</li>
<li>The system should be able to distinguish between a person and a car.</li>
<li>A switch is available that can be closed only by the weight of a car.</li>
<li>System is used in the hotel- so you can assume that a valet parking system is followed – this
indicates that only one person leaves the garage after the car is parked and only a single person
enters the garage to retrieve the car.</li>
<li>The system also has to distinguish between entry and exit. You have to develop a scheme to
distinguish between entry and exit of person/car. [Hint: Use any number of IR sensor pairs as
required]</li>
<li>Whether a car enters or a valet enters the door remains open for a period of five minutes.</li>
<li>he door can close after 5 Minutes or when the valet uses the remote.</li>
<li>The remote can be used inside as well as outside the garage</li>
</ol>
